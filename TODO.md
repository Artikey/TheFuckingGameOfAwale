# TODO
## This is the TODO file where we place the things we need to implement


###

1. implement the enemy part of the game
    * maybe a neural network ?

2. implement the graphics of the RPG styled "Bar"

3. comment and clean all the code
    * need an IDE (I use eclipse with PyDev) to refactor the code for the wrong
      variable names
